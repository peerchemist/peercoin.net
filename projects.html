                        <p class="desc">A simple explanation on how PeerAssets protocol works would be that it works by writing and reading messages on the blockchain, where messages represent assets and addresses represent peers.<br><br>
                            PeerAsset protocol based assets can be utilized to represent any type of asset like bonds or equity. PeerAssets can also represent real life objects, and by doing so confirm their existence on the blockchain. PeerAssets is a light protocol, as it utilizes no extra layers over the underlying blockchain. It does not require external value tokens beside the blockchain's native currency, which is used to pay transaction fees. PeerAssets does not participate in organizing nor maintaining of the public ledger, but takes advantage of its stability and trustworthiness. PeerAssets can work on top of every cryptocurrency that is forked from Bitcoin and has kept a compatible codebase, which includes Peercoin, Litecoin and alike.<br><br>
                            PeerAssets require no hard nor soft fork of the host network, but it requires development of PeerAssets aware client. PeerAssets is also inspired by the original idea of "Colored Coins" and uses OP_RETURN to write data on the blockchain, but offers some optimizations to reduce amount of data written in the OP_RETURN. PeerAssets enables easy querying of the blockchain for relevant transactions and offers some extra features like shareholder voting and dividends payouts.<br><br>

                            “Perpera” is an implementation of the PeerAssets DataAudit protocol which was first presented as an RFC in June, 2018. Perpera is a library written in TypeScript and aims to cater to the needs of future web-based applications and development/power user focused CLI tools.<br><br>
                            The main purpose of this protocol is the embedding of arbitrary documents into the blockchain (proof-of-existence) and the ability to revise said documents. In this aspect (support for revisions), this protocol is different than similar protocols which are already in use.<br><br>
                            More on the PeerAssets DataAudit protocol:<br><br>
                            <i>
                            The primary purpose of this protocol is to record cryptographic hashes of successive revisions of single-file documents in a public blockchain, in a manner which enables thin clients to easily query and verify document histories. Such histories inherit useful properties from the underlying blockchain, namely immutability and massive replication, and can therefore serve as proofs of existence.
                            In addition to cryptographic hashes, users may also record a collection of URLs for each document, facilitating retrieval of document contents from off-chain sources (IPFS, https, torrent).
                            The goal is to impose minimal requirements on the blockchain, in terms of both features and storage space.</i><br><br>
